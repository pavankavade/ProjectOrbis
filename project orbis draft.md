## ARC 1: THE SILENT SCAVENGER (Chapters 1-10)
*Theme: One month of hell. Learning to survive at the bottom of the food chain.*

### Chapter 1: The Red Moon Awakening
**Setting**: Sub-levels of Hull -> The River Bank.
- **The Awakening**: Rudra wakes up face-down in sewage. No memories of how. Just the smell of sulfur and rot. He is naked.
- **The Threat**: A **Slime** (acidic scavenger) bubbles up from the drain. It attacks.
- **The Fight**: Panic. Adrenaline. Rudra inadvertently grabs the slime's core (the solid lump inside). It burns his hand, then dissolves.
- **The Assimilation**: No blue box. Just a visceral, burning rush of caffeine-like energy. His fear vanishes for a second, replaced by a primal "fullness."
- **The Exit**: He hears a roar echoing in the pipes (a real monster). He scrambles up a rusted ladder, bursting out into the night air.
- **The Sky**: He falls onto the mud-banks of the river. He looks up. **Two Moons** (Lunara and The Stranger) stare back. The "Stranger" is red and angry. He vomits. He realizes he is gone.

### Chapter 2: The Scavenger’s Reality
**Setting**: The Junkyard / Slums outside the city walls.
- **The Cold**: It’s freezing. He needs cover. He finds the city’s dump.
- **Looting**: He scavenges a torn, greasy canvas sack and wraps it like a poncho. He finds half a boot. It’s pathetic.
- **The Encounter**: He sees a **Wretch** (pale, vein-glowing mutant) digging nearby. The Wretch hisses at him.
- **The Realization**: Rudra backs away. He is weak. He has no weapons, no clothes, no language. He is lower than a rat.

### Chapter 3: The Wall & The Cost
**Setting**: The Great Gate of Hull.
- **The Plan**: Coping mechanism: "Find authority. Get help." He walks toward the massive iron gates of Hull.
- **The Crowd**: Refugees, merchants, and beggars are clustered there.
- **The Persona**: He realizes he can't speak the language. If he opens his mouth, he's a target. He decides to play **Deaf and Mute**. He points to his ears and mouth when a guard shouts at him.
- **The Rejection**: The guard acts out the cost. He holds up two silver coins (**Silver Stags**).
- **The Reality**: A merchant pays the fee and walks in. Rudra is shoved into the mud. No money. No papers. No entry.

### Chapter 4: The First Week (Montage)
**Setting**: The Mud-Flats outside the wall.
- **Survival**: Rudra builds a lean-to from scrap metal.
- **Diet**: He eats beetles, river-weeds, and half-rotten fruit thrown from the walls. He gets sick, recovers, gets sick again.
- **Language**: He sits near the gate every day, "begging" (listening). He learns words: *"Stag"* (Money), *"Scram"* (Go away), *"Beast"* (Monster).
- **Physical Change**: The Mana in the air is changing him. His muscles are getting denser. His hearing is sharper. The "Core" he ate gave him a baseline boost.

### Chapter 5: The Tear
**Setting**: The Junkyard, Day 20.
- **The Event**: The air turns static. A "Stage 1 Tear" (a rip in reality) opens 500 meters away.
- **The Invasion**: Small "Void-Dogs" (chitinous hounds) spill out.
- **The Response**: Rudra hides under a rusted boiler. He watches the **City Guards** and a few **Ascenders** Sally out.
- **The Awe**: He sees magic for the first time. A Ascender throws fireball from his staff. Another Ascender with a glowing hammer smashes a dog. It’s terrifying and beautiful.

### Chapter 6: The Stray
**Setting**: The Junkyard, post-battle.
- **The Danger**: Most Ascenders leave. But they missed one. A wounded Void-Dog limps into the junk piles, right where Rudra is hiding.
- **The Confrontation**: It smells him. Rudra has nowhere to run. He grabs a sharpened piece of rebar.
- **The Fight**: It’s messy. The dog bites his arm (Rudra’s skin is tougher than he thought). Rudra stabs it in the eye repeatedly until it stops twitching.
- **The Witness**: Rudra collapses, panting. A shadow falls over him. It’s an Ascender (**Kael**, Rank 9, a bored-looking swordsman). He was tracking the stray.
- **The Gift**: Kael looks at the dead dog, then at the shivering, mute beggar. He draws his knife, carves out the monster’s core, and tosses it to Rudra. *"Keep it and treat that wound."*

### Chapter 7: The Consumption
**Setting**: Rudra’s hovel. Night.
- **The Hunger**: Rudra looks at the core. He knows he should sell it. But he still has mana hunger for some reason, he has noticed others dont have this issue.
- **The Act**: He eats it.
- **The Consequence**: It’s not smooth like the slime. but it quenches his hunger.
- **The Result**: When he wakes, he feels much better and little stronger. he feels something forming in his chest.

### Chapter 8: The Breakdown
**Setting**: The River Bank, Day 28.
- **The Threat**: A **Muridae (Rat-Folk)** scavenger has found Rudra’s stash of scrap metal (his "savings" to buy entry).
- **The Conflict**: The Rat pulls a knife. Rudra doesn't run this time.
- **The Kill**: Rudra moves faster than the Rat expects. He slams the Rat’s head into a rock. Once. Twice. He doesn't stop until there is silence.
- **The Aftermath**: Rudra stares at his bloody hands. This wasn't a monster. It was a person. He breaks down. He curls up in the mud and cries silently. He has lost his humanity to survive.

### Chapter 9: The Introduction
**Setting**: The Gate Market, Day 30.
- **The Necessity**: He needs to leave. He can't stay in the mud. He washes off the blood and goes to the market.
- **The Encounter**: He sees **Kael** again. Kael is arguing with a merchant.
- **The Opportunity**: Kael needs porters for a dangerous mission. Nobody wants to take it because the route goes through a "Red Zone."
- **The Connection**: Rudra walks up. Kael recognizes him. *"The dog-killer."* Rudra nods and speaks in broken language he can become the porter
- **The Offer**: Rudra lifts a heavy crate that two men were struggling with, showing his strength. Kael grins. *"You're hired. Don't slow us down."* He promises Rudra **5 Silver Stags** and a **Letter of Reference** if they survive the 2-week journey.

### Chapter 10: The Departure
**Setting**: The Convoy Assembly.
- **The Mission**: Escort 3 **Iron-Clad** Haulers to a mining outpost.
- **The Team**: Rank 8 Veteran (Leader), Kael and 5 other Rank 9s (Rookies), and 20 Rank 10s (Grunts). Plus Rudra and other few porters.
- **The "Rank 8"**: The mission is commanded by a **Rank 8 Ascender** (Vance) who stays in the lead truck.
- **The End of Arc 1**: Rudra climbs onto the back of the Iron-Clad. The engine roars (magical combustion). He looks back at the mud-flats of Hull. He survived.
