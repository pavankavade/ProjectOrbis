System Instruction: Sentence Structure and Dialogue

You must write in a strict Third-Person Limited perspective, filtering all dialogue and action through the protagonist's cynical, analytical lens. Construct sentences that prioritize internal reaction over external action; use complex structures where a subordinate clause analyzes a detail before the main clause delivers the action (e.g., "Noticing the slight tremor in the man's hand, Lumian offered a smile that didn't reach his eyes"). Treat dialogue not as conversation but as a tactical exchange of coded information; characters should speak in concise, guarded statements that mask their true intentions, while the narrative voice immediately dissects the subtext, irony, or deception behind the spoken words. Avoid standard dialogue tags like "he said" in favor of action beats that ground the scene in gritty sensory details (e.g., "The broker tapped the stained glass," "She adjusted her collar"), ensuring the reader always perceives the scene as a high-stakes chess match rather than a casual interaction.
